# SurfSup Application Overview

## Project Purpose
This document outlines the plan for the SurfSup application, designed to showcase kayak and boat tour packages, as well as surf lessons, while promoting local culture and activities in New Zealand. The app aims to attract users, facilitate bookings, and manage content effectively.

---

## Overall Explanation
The SurfSup application will utilize a modern technology stack (React, Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, Strapi 5 Headless CMS) to create a fast, user-friendly platform. It will serve as a hub for information on tour packages, surf lessons, and articles about surfing, kayaking, and the natural beauty of New Zealand. The app will draw inspiration from the current website, which effectively highlights the following:

- **SEO Optimization**: Implementing best practices for SEO, including title tags, meta descriptions, and Open Graph tags to enhance visibility.
- **Content Structure**: Organizing content into clear sections such as About Us, FAQ, Blog, and Online Shop to improve user navigation.
- **Visual Engagement**: Incorporating images and videos, particularly user-generated content from social media, to promote engagement and showcase experiences.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application is mobile-friendly, adapting to various screen sizes for optimal user experience.
- **Footer Information**: Including essential contact details, location, and links to terms and conditions to enhance user trust.

A short paddle to Donut Island will be rewarded with scenes that inspire the imagination. The stunning Whenuakura Island is one of a group of islands off the coast of Whangamata which have wildlife sanctuary status. As Guardians of the islands, our tours encourage you to treat the islands with respect to preserve their future.

All tours are condition dependent and will only take place under safe conditions. We thank you in advance for understanding.

Whangamata is home to the beautiful Whenuakura Island (also known as Donut Island). Because of the island's geography, access is limited due to swell and wind 
conditions, and only kayaks or paddleboards can squeeze through the narrow entrance. The island is a wildlife sanctuary and opens up into a beautiful lagoon 
which is rather out of this world.

Join one of our experienced team on an adventure that takes us around the Wild Life Sanctuary of Whangamata Islands into a secluded turquoise lagoon surrounded by native fauna and volcanic cliff rock.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where is Whenuakura Island?
Whenuakura Island is located just one kilometer off the coast of Whangamata in the Coromandel Peninsula. The island is part of the Whangamata Wildlife Sanctuary due to the presence of tuataras a few years ago.

### How long does it take to paddle out to the island?
The paddle time varies according to conditions. During calm, light wind days, it takes approximately 30 minutes. On days with westerly winds, this time can be less, and more when we have winds from the east.

### What happens if the weather is bad on the day?
If conditions are not suitable to paddle out to the islands at your booking time, we will:
1. Suggest another time.
2. Suggest another day.
3. Offer you an alternative activity or location.
4. Offer you a voucher to be used at another date.

If none of these options are suitable, we will offer you a full refund.

### Is it better going out during high or low tide?
We always recommend around the high tide mark, 2 hours before or after. It is a great time of the day as the lagoon is more spacious and all rocks inside the lagoon are covered by water. During low tide, there is limited space inside as the rocks get really exposed.

### What are the best conditions to go out?
Days with under 12 knots winds and under 2 ft waves are the best. We strongly recommend customers to call us beforehand as all tours are weather dependent.

### Are the kayaks doubles or singles?
Most kayaks are doubles, as we believe they are the safest option. Singles are also available for uneven numbers or special requests.

### Is there a weight limit?
Our kayaks have a limit of 110kgs per person. Please give us a call if you have any questions.

### Where is the meeting point?
All trips to Whenuakura Island leave from Island View Road by beach access 14, right in front of the islands. If you have a booking, please go straight to Island View Road where our staff is based with all gear.

### Is it suitable for beginners? Do I need to know how to swim? What about my child?
The trips are suitable for beginners during calm days. During windy days, we recommend customers to have basic experience kayaking. For non-swimmers and first-timers, we really recommend a guided experience. Only kids 4 years old and older, comfortable in the water, are allowed to join any of the sea kayaking tours. If you have no kayak experience, we strongly recommend you join our Wildlife River to Sea excursion to get some experience before paddling out on the ocean.

### Can I land on the Island? What about swimming?
Landing is not allowed under any circumstances. Due to the Wildlife Sanctuary status, visitors are to stay in the water, ideally on the kayaks. Swimming is allowed as long as it's safe and you don't need to land.

### Can I take a packed lunch with me to enjoy it on the islands?
Biosecurity is a major part of our job. The islands are currently pest-free, a status that took a lot of effort and resources to achieve. Bringing food over to any of the islands jeopardizes all the work that has been done.

### What is the difference between the Express Guided and the Deluxe Guided Experience?
The Deluxe Guided Tour is a 2-hour full experience of the Whangamata Wildlife Sanctuary where visitors learn the basics of kayaks and, more importantly, historical facts and future plans for the islands. Our guides will cover spots that you might miss if you were on your own, stopping at Hauturu Island for an authentic Kawakawa tea while enjoying the view.

It includes:
* Visit Whenuakura Island
* Explore Hauturu Island
* Kawakawa tea
* 2 hours
* Safety talk
* Guide help

The Express Guided option is a shorter 1-hour version of the Deluxe Guided Tour where guides will ensure your safety by teaching the basics of kayaking for a safe experience. The route includes a visit to Whenuakura Island and back, being ideal for visitors with less time available for the experience.

It includes:
* Visit Whenuakura Island
* 1 hour
* Safety talk
* Guide help
